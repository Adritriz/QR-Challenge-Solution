### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
body {
    background-color: var(--BODY-BGCOLOR);
    color: var(--FONT-COLOR);
    width: 300px;
    height: auto;
    border: 1px solid white;
    margin: var(--BODY-MARGIN);
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    border-radius: 20px;
    box-shadow: 0 30px 10px 5px hsl(212, 37%, 85%);;
}

```



### Continued development

As a newbie, I found it difficult to understand CSS such as when and how to use certain properties and values, however, with this project I found myself locking in on what can work and did many trial and errors. In the end I found what works and have a deeper understanding of why I need to use certain properties such as centering the body and making sure it stays centered when using different devices. In future projects I will focus on developing my CSS skills.
